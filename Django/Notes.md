## Installation

- check the python latest version using `python` command
  
### Install Django globally using command
- `py -m pip install Django`
- run `django-admin` command to check django is successfully installed
- now run `py -m django --version` to check version
  
### Installing django in a separate virtual environment
- `py -m venv project-name` -This will create a folder called ‘project-name’ if it does not already exist and setup the virtual environment
- here project-name is our virtual environment 
- `project-name\Scripts\activate.bat`-The virtual environment will be activated and you’ll see “(project-name)” next to the command prompt to designate that. Each time you start a new command prompt, you’ll need to activate the environment again

- Now install django here using the django installation commands
  `py -m pip install Django`
- Now we can run `django-admin` or `django-admin --version` command to check whether django is working or not

- run `deactivate` to deactivate the virtual environment
